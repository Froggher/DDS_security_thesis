  title={Study on Data Transmission of DCPS Publish-Subscribe Model}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-2172},
  abstract={There're two delivery models of data distuibution service(DDS) which is published by OMG, “best-effort delivery model” and “reliable delivery model”. DDS uses best-effort delivery by default in the communication. However, “best-effort delivery” can't satisfy the reliability of communication. This paper researches on reliable delivery model and analyses how the reliable protocol of DDS works in nomal and sample-lost situations. Relative QoS policies are configured to set up sizes of sending queue and receiving queue and frequency of heartbeat messages. At last, the comparision of best-effort delivery and reliable delivery declares the situations which the two models apply to.},

abstract = {The publish/subscribe communication system has been a popular communication model in many areas. Especially, it is well suited for a distributed real-time system in many ways. However, the research of cost model and analysis of publish/subscribe system in a distributed real-time system have not been suggested yet. In this paper, we present our cost model for publish/subscribe system in a real-time domain, analyze its performance, and compare it with other communication models such as request/reply and polling models. Our empirical result on mobile embedded device shows accordance with cost analysis, which verifies correctness and usefulness of our cost model.}
